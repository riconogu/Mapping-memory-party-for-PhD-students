            <p class="pre-wrap masthead-subheading font-weight-light mb-0">Friendships are critical to meaningful scholarship. In fact, they're sometimes the source of the most groundbreaking and successful ideas. (Just think about Marx and Engels!) One of the most straightforward ways we can build new friendships is through partying...at least when humanity isn't grappling with a global pandemic. Here, we present a nostalgic map for grad students at Michigan State University who've found places where friendships could grow with the help of intoxicating (or intoxicated) conversations, conversations interrupted by occasional dance and revelry, or all of those things at the same time. <br><br>Not every young scholar has the same amount of party-driven spirit. There're both apollonian and dionysian scholars. Considering that, we're presenting here three types of sites that grad students visited before the Age of COVID-19 according to how apollonian or dionysian they felt. For those without much love for loud music or alcohol consumption, we refer places for decent academic friendships (represented by coffee cups). For those looking to know their peers a little bit better after some "spirit boosting" with loud music and drinking, we offer places for insane academic friendships (represented by glasses of beer). Finally, for those rare scholar-dionysian souls who explored things that they probably shouldn't have explored with their peers, we cautiously denote no guarantees kinds of places (represented by skulls). <br><br>We hope this map helps you remember how you grew your scholarly friendships while showing you where to build (or not build) new ones when the pandemic is over.</p>

Unlike some of the other bars near the MSU campus, the Peanut Barrel didn't tend to attract a vast number of undergrads pre-COVID; if it did, it wasn't too obvious. Some grad students will appreciate that for reasons that don't require an ethnographic analysis to explain. The place can be loud sometimes, but it'll never be loud enough to make you think you're having a wild and amazing time with drunken friends. Both your peers and the bar's personnel may expect decency and some degree of propriety from you.</p>");

It has incredible discounts, and the quality of their products is great. However, you can't expect a quiet conversation about capitalism's principles or the political turmoils in Venezuela while you're hanging at Harper's. Things can get out of hand quickly, and you may end up knowing more than you want about your peers (and others in your vicinity). First of all, Harper's has a dance floor, so things might get awkward if your peers decide to go and try it. Harper's also attracts hundreds of undergrads, especially on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. Consequently, some of your students or lab assistants may end up watching you trying to catch the rhythm with your intellectual body movements. Finally, thanks to recent world events and some degree of administrative and collective carelessness, you and your peers may end up knowing more than you want about the kinds of <a href='https://eastlansinginfo.news/new-data-show-how-the-harpers-superspreader-event-played-out/' target='_blank'>viruses</a> some were hosting in their bodies. No guarantees here, especially since this is a place where <a href='https://twitter.com/kyra_wieber/status/1285303595152408578' target='_blank'>not all seem to be welcome</a>.</p>");

You can also expect to have productive conversations about your next research projects with your peers. As long as you can have that kind of talk in a sometimes lousy environment, you'll be fine! However, Dublin Square is a place with a hidden door that can be easily mistaken for a leprechaun's pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Parties will be wild behind that door, and you could try to learn a little bit more about your peers advancing into that uncharted territory with the help of a couple tequila shots. Once there, you should know that you'll face undergrads and a dance floor. By the end of the night, the tequilas in your head will remind you of all those good things you were not expecting from your peers.</p>");

Located in Lansing, The Avenue doesn't attract a lot of undergrads into its dark interior. Tens of pinball machines offer something to do while reflecting on the arguments a peer gave you to consider how misguided your dissertation project actually is. There are two pool tables to show off, and some arcade machines as well. If it's their lucky day, people coming to The Avenue may end up watching a queer country music band animating the closeted socialists to come out. When you can find all those kinds of things in a single place, you shouldn't expect less of those sorts of things from your peers. If it's true your dissertation project is a little misguided, it's also true you have a good grad student friend drinking that loaded beer right beside you.</p>");

The music is good, and when the night is right, the party will be as hard as you need it to watch your American peers throwing their forbidden dance moves. You'll also find unique and caring employees who'll no doubt kick you out if you get a little too drunk. Drunkness and The Green Door don't fit together, but some testimonies suggest harassment of women at The Green Door can happen sometimes. Hopefully, you won't have to encounter random displays of sexism, and you'll get a night to remember as well as a stronger bond with your peers.</p>");
